# Network-Guides
***In this series i will cover different network topics like DNS, DHCP, SSL (certmanager + letsencrypt).*** 
- The guides derive from my personal research, work and will also be available on medium as blogs.

## 1. DNS 
> we will install our own private DNS
> we configure the DNS to resolve our personal Dashboard Domains
> we learn how and why to prevent our personal data from snooping-attacks and datamining
> - this is the basis to setup cloud9 to avoid public DNS queries and therefore a huge attack-vector
