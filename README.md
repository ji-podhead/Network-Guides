# Network-Guides
***In this series i will cover different network topics like DNS, DHCP, SSL (certmanager + letsencrypt).*** 
- The content derives from my personal research, work and will also be available on medium as blog-posts.

## 1. DNS 
> - we will install our own private DNS
> - we configure the DNS to resolve our personal Dashboard Domains
> - we learn how to debug our dns 
> we learn how and why to prevent our personal data from snooping-attacks and datamining
> - this is the basis to setup cloud9 to avoid public DNS queries and therefore a huge attack-vector
> - in the next step we configure our DNS in combination with our own private DHCP and subnets
