## Tools

### Automatic Testing
The need for the following Methods can vary based on your Infrastructure.
Automated testing can help you to discover potential risks, whether this depends on permissions, law-violation, or unsecure code and is therefore crucial to Appsec and DevOps.

### Network-Intrusion Detection and Prevention
In IDS, signatures are patterns indicating known attacks or system misuse, from simple data character recognition to complex behaviors. Signature-based IDS alert upon matching predefined patterns, adjustable via scripting languages. This method is easy to understand but requires listing all attack modifications for recognition, increasing the risk of false positives and the need for personnel to analyze alerts.

### Vulnerability Scanners
A vulnerability scanner is a program that evaluates computers, networks, or applications for known vulnerabilities, identifying weaknesses due to misconfigurations or faulty programming in network assets like firewalls, routers, servers, etc. Modern scanners offer both authenticated and unauthenticated scans, with the former requiring access using remote admin protocols like SSH or RDP and system credentials, allowing detailed OS and software info. Unauthenticated scans may yield many false positives and lack detailed asset information, often used by attackers or analysts to assess external asset security.
